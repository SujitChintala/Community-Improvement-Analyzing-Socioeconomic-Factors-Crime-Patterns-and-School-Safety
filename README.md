# **Community Improvement: Analyzing Socioeconomic Factors, Crime Patterns, and School Safety in Chicago.**


## **Project Overview:**
### This project aims to explore various factors affecting community well-being in Chicago. By analyzing Chicago's census data, public school safety data, and crime data, the goal is to provide insights and suggestions for improving community safety and prosperity.


## **The analysis focuses on three key objectives:**
### 1. Understanding the factors contributing to higher hardship levels in different areas of Chicago.
### 2. Identifying crime-prone locations and the most common types of crime in Chicago.
### 3. Evaluating the safety standards of elementary, middle, and high schools across Chicago.


### The findings aim to help in making data-driven decisions to improve community outcomes.


## **Objectives:**
### 1. **Hardship Index Analysis:** Identify factors influencing hardship levels and suggest measures to reduce hardship.
### 2. **Crime Pattern Analysis:** Analyze crime locations and types to suggest crime prevention strategies.
### 3. **School Safety Evaluation:** Compare the safety standards of elementary, middle, and high schools to suggest areas for improvement.


## **Data:**
### This project uses the following data sets:
### - **Chicago Census Data:** Socioeconomic data related to income and education levels across Chicago.
### - **Chicago Public Schools Data:** Data on safety standards and incidents in public schools.
### - **Chicago Crime Data:** Data on crime types and locations across the city.


## *Analysis & Insights:**
### The analysis led to the following key findings:
### 1. **Hardship Index and Socioeconomic Factors:** Higher per capita income correlates with a lower Hardship Index. Areas with better education and income levels experience lower hardship.
### 2. **Crime Patterns:** The majority of crimes occur on streets, followed by residences, sidewalks, and apartments. Theft is the most common crime, followed by battery, criminal damage, and narcotics.
### 3. **School Safety:** All three types of schools—elementary, middle, and high schools—show similar safety standards, with middle schools being slightly less safe than others.


## **Suggestions:**
### Based on the analysis, the following suggestions are proposed:
### **To reduce hardship:** Focus on raising income levels and improving educational opportunities in low-income areas.
### **To reduce crime:** Increase community engagement and policing efforts in high-crime areas.
### **To improve school safety:** Implement targeted safety programs in middle schools and strengthen safety measures across all schools.


## **Technologies Used:**
### **Python:** Used for data analysis and processing.
### **SQL:** Used for querying and managing the database.
### **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
### **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
### **SQLite3:** For storing and managing the data.


## **Conclusion:**
### This project provides data-driven insights into factors affecting the quality of life in Chicago. By focusing on areas such as income, education, crime prevention, and school safety, the analysis suggests targeted actions to improve community welfare and safety.
